NOTE: You must have pyserial and pygame installed to run Cel.

How to run Cel on macOS terminal:
1. Navigate to the Cel directory in your terminal
2. Use the command "python3 main.py" (or other python compiler)

The not_using directory contains old code. We save them here just in case we need them again or need to refer to them.

//FIXME: As of now, the player is moved with the arrow keys, spacebar freezes the player. Once we implement functionality with the Arduino, the player will be moved with the Arduino.

You can quit by pressing the ESC key.
