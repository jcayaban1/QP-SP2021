Spring 2021 Quarterly Project

NOTE:
1. You must have pyserial and pygame installed to run Cel.
2. Game.py line 28 must have the correct name of the serial port that is connected to the Arduino. The name of the port can be found in the Arduino IDE under "tools > Port"


How to run Cel on macOS terminal:
1. Navigate to the Cel directory in your terminal
2. Use the command "python3 main.py" (or other python compiler)
3. Input the number of players to control into the terminal
4. The game will begin after inputting the number of players

The not_using directory contains old code. We save them here just in case we need them again or need to refer to them.

//FIXME: As of now, the player is moved with the arrow keys, spacebar freezes the player. Once we implement functionality with the Arduino, the player will be moved with the Arduino.

You can quit by pressing the ESC key.
